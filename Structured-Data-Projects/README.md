ðŸ“Š Understanding Structured Data

Structured data refers to highly organized and easily searchable data types that are arranged in a tabular format, often found in rows and columns. This data typically resides in databases like SQL, where each field has a defined data type (e.g., integer, text, date).

In my projects, I use structured data to:

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights.
Build predictive models using algorithms like decision trees, linear regression, and more.
Clean and preprocess data, handling missing values, outliers, and scaling.
Some common sources of structured data include:

Relational databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
CSV files or Excel sheets
APIs providing structured datasets (JSON or XML format)
Through these projects, you'll see how structured data helps build powerful, data-driven solutions!
